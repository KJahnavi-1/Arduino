# ðŸš¦ Traffic Lights Operation

This Arduino project simulates a **traffic signal system** using three LEDsâ€”red, yellow, and green. It models a simple time-based traffic light logic, making it a great beginner project to understand pin control, timing, and sequencing.

## ðŸ”§ Components Required

- 1 x Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- 1 x Red LED  
- 1 x Yellow LED  
- 1 x Green LED  
- 3 x 220Î© resistors  
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Diagram

Connect each LED to its corresponding pin via a resistor:

- Arduino Pin 13 â”€â”€â”€â–º [220Î© Resistor] â”€â”€â”€â–º [Red LED Anode]
- Arduino Pin 11 â”€â”€â”€â–º [220Î© Resistor] â”€â”€â”€â–º [Yellow LED Anode]
- Arduino Pin 9 â”€â”€â”€â–º [220Î© Resistor] â”€â”€â”€â–º [Green LED Anode]
- All LED Cathodes â”€â”€â”€â–º GND

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The code cycles through three LEDs with equal time delays:
1. **Red LED ON** â€“ Stop
2. **Yellow LED ON** â€“ Get ready
3. **Green LED ON** â€“ Go

Each state lasts for 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds).
