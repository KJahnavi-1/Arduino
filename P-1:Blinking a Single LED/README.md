# ðŸ’¡ Blinking a Single LED

This is a basic Arduino project demonstrating how to **blink a single LED** using digital output and the `delay()` function. It's often the very first program used to get started with Arduino!

---

## ðŸ”§ Components Required

- 1 x Arduino Uno 
- 1 x LED
- 1 x 220Î© resistor
- Breadboard and jumper wires

---

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Diagram

- Connect the **long leg (anode)** of the LED to **digital pin 12** through the **220Î© resistor**
- Connect the **short leg (cathode)** of the LED to **GND**
